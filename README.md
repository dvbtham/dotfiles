### :arrow_down: Installation:

Get started quickly:

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dvbtham/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Get into the repo and run the install script

   ```bash
   cd dotfiles && ./install.rb
   ```

3. Add theme colors to iTerm (optional)

   I use [ngaicojal theme](https://github.com/dvbtham/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/themes/ngaicojal.zsh-theme)
   you're interested in having the similar visual appearance.

That is it. If you find something broken or worth fixing, create an issue and /
or a pull request and let's make it better.

### :mag: It includes:

 - `.vimrc`, a config file for Vim file editor
 - `.gitconfig`, a config file for Git CLI
 - `.zsh-aliases`, a file that contains aliases for the Z shell
 - `install.rb`, bash script for installing those files

:warning: Use it at your peril. :warning:

:radio: Pull request are (very) welcome.
